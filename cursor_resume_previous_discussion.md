**User**

lets resume

**Cursor**

Okay, we're at **Step 4.2.3. Define any custom `StructureDefinition` or `ValueSet` FHIR resources if required beyond standard FHIR for ophthalmic data.**

As a reminder, I had asked:
"Could you explore the Medplum app (as your super-admin user) and see if you can find where you would create or manage these types of FHIR conformance resources (`StructureDefinition` and `ValueSet`)? You don't need to create any yet, just locate the relevant sections."

Please let me know if you were able to find where `StructureDefinition` and `ValueSet` resources are managed within the Medplum admin app.

---

**User**

I am seeing options to update the database StructureDefinitions from the FHIR specification and update the database ValueSets from the FHIR specification.

---

**Cursor**

That's a good find! Those options allow you to ensure your local Medplum instance's understanding of standard FHIR resources is up-to-date with the official FHIR specification. This is useful for baseline conformance.

Now, for *custom* definitions:

Usually, in the same area or a related section where you manage FHIR resources (often labeled "FHIR Resources," "Project," or within an "Admin" section), you should be able to:
1.  **View existing `StructureDefinition` and `ValueSet` resources** (including standard ones and any custom ones you might add).
2.  **Create new `StructureDefinition` and `ValueSet` resources** from scratch (often by defining them in JSON or using a form-based editor if available).
3.  **Upload/Import `StructureDefinition` and `ValueSet` resources** (e.g., if you define them in a JSON file).

Could you look for options like "Create New," "Upload," or a general list view for `StructureDefinition` and `ValueSet` where you might add your own, beyond just updating from the FHIR specification?

For example, you might see a list of all `StructureDefinition`s and an "Add New" or "Upload" button, or a section in the sidebar for "StructureDefinitions" and "ValueSets" that takes you to a management page.

This is to confirm you know where you *would* go to add your custom definitions if and when your project requires them. No need to create any actual custom resources at this moment.

---

**User**

i cannot see these options. the admin app only allows me to rebuild the structure definitions

---

**Cursor**

Okay, thank you for that clarification. It's possible that the primary admin interface you're looking at focuses on the instance-wide schema. Custom `StructureDefinition`s and `ValueSet`s are often managed within the context of a specific Project, or via direct FHIR API interactions.

Let's try this:
1.  In the Medplum app, can you navigate to a section where you can view different types of FHIR resources? (e.g., a "Resources" tab, or perhaps by selecting "StructureDefinition" or "ValueSet" from a dropdown list of resource types).
2.  Once you are viewing a list of existing `StructureDefinition`s (even if it's just the standard ones), do you see any buttons like "New," "Create," "Upload," or a "+" icon that would allow you to add a new one?
3.  Do the same for `ValueSet`s.

Sometimes the creation tools are part of the general resource browsing/management interface rather than a specific "Admin" panel for conformance resources.

If you still don't see direct UI options for creating new custom ones after checking this, that's okay. For the purpose of **Step 4.2.3**, it's enough to acknowledge that:
    a. You know Medplum *supports* custom `StructureDefinition`s and `ValueSet`s (as this is a core FHIR capability).
    b. You know where to update/rebuild the *base* FHIR specification definitions.
    c. When the time comes to actually *create* custom ones (if needed), we can do so by uploading JSON definitions via the Medplum API or a Medplum Bot, even if a direct UI button isn't immediately apparent in your current view.

For now, the conceptual understanding is key. We can proceed if you're comfortable with the idea that custom definitions can be added, and we'll cross the bridge of *how* (UI vs. API) when we need a specific custom resource.

Does that sound reasonable? Or would you like to try looking in one more place? For instance, sometimes these are managed within a "Default Project" or the first project created.

**User**

the admin app allows me to view the FHIR resources. I can search for them, and then view all instances of a particular resource on a given page in a table form. I can add, delete and edit existing resources. For example, I can create a Patient resource, edit it, delete it

---

**Cursor**

That's perfect! If you can use that interface to search for existing `StructureDefinition` and `ValueSet` resources, and it provides "Add" (or "Create" / "New"), "Edit," and "Delete" buttons for them, then you've found the place.

Could you please try this:
1.  In the FHIR resource viewer where you were able to create a `Patient`, try to search for or select the resource type **`StructureDefinition`**.
2.  Once you see a list of `StructureDefinition`s, check if you have buttons like "Add," "New," "Create," or a "+" icon that would allow you to define a new `StructureDefinition`.
3.  Do the same for the resource type **`ValueSet`**.

If those "Add"/"Create" options are available for `StructureDefinition` and `ValueSet` in the same way they are for `Patient`, then you know how to manage them directly through the UI.

Let me know what you find!

---

**User**

yes i can see both structure definition and valueset in the same way. I can create, edit, delete, view them in the same way

---

**Cursor**

Excellent! That confirms you've found the correct place in the UI to manage `StructureDefinition`s and `ValueSet`s. This is exactly what we needed for **Step 4.2.3**. You now know where to go if/when you need to define custom FHIR structures or terminologies for your ophthalmic platform.

With that, we've completed all parts of **Step 4.2. Initial Local Medplum Configuration**:
*   4.2.1. You've created a super-admin account.
*   4.2.2. You've reviewed where default settings (like authentication) are, understanding that some (like email/server URLs) are backend-configured.
*   4.2.3. You've located where to manage `StructureDefinition`s and `ValueSet`s.

We are now ready to move to **Step 4.3. Project Structure and Access Control Design (Conceptual & Local Implementation).**

The first sub-step here is **4.3.1. Multi-Project Strategy Definition:**
This involves understanding the concept: *Establish a clear process for creating a new Medplum `Project` for each participating hospital/site.*

Medplum `Project`s are the core mechanism for data segregation. Each hospital will have its own `Project`. All FHIR resources created for that hospital (Patients, Observations, Images, etc.) will belong to that hospital's `Project`. This ensures that Hospital A cannot see Hospital B's data, and vice-versa.

For this step, there isn't a specific action to take in the app yet, but rather a conceptual understanding.
*   You, as the platform owner, will be responsible for creating a new Medplum `Project` when a new hospital is onboarded.
*   Hospital staff users will be associated with their specific hospital's `Project`.
*   Pharmaceutical company users might be given access to multiple hospital `Project`s, but with very restricted, read-only, de-identified views (which we'll configure later with `AccessPolicy` resources).
*   Your company admin users (like the super-admin you created) will typically have access across all `Project`s.

Does this concept of using one Medplum `Project` per hospital make sense as the foundation for data isolation?

---

**User**

Yes it makes sense. Before we proceed, can you access the admin app using my local browser and the puppeteer mcp server i have configured

---

**Cursor**

I can certainly attempt to navigate to your local Medplum admin app using the Puppeteer tools.

To do this, I'll need the exact URL that your local Medplum admin app is currently running on. You previously mentioned it might be `http://localhost:3000/` or `http://localhost:8100/`.

Could you please confirm the correct URL for your Medplum admin app?

Once I have the URL, I will use the navigation tool to open it. Please ensure your Puppeteer MCP server is running and accessible.

---

**User**

its localhost 3000

---

**Cursor**

Okay, I will now attempt to navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

I have successfully navigated to `http://localhost:3000`.

To confirm I'm seeing the Medplum admin app, I can take a screenshot. Would you like me to do that?

---

**User**

yes, also please login using the following credentials. 
Username: admin@example.com, password is medplum_admin

---

**Cursor**

Okay, I'll take a screenshot of the current page first.

I've taken the screenshot. It should show the Medplum login page.

Now, I will attempt to log in using the credentials you provided:
*   Username: `admin@example.com`
*   Password: `medplum_admin`

I'll need to identify the CSS selectors for the username field, password field, and the login button. Common selectors are often `input[name='email']` or `input[type='email']` for the username/email, `input[name='password']` or `input[type='password']` for the password, and `button[type='submit']` for the login button. I'll try these first.

It seems I was able to fill the email, but I encountered an issue with the password field using the selector `input[name='password']` â€“ it timed out. This might mean the selector for the password field is different.

However, I also proceeded to click the submit button.

To see the result of this login attempt, I'll take another screenshot.

I've taken a screenshot named `after_login_attempt`. Please check it.

If the login was unsuccessful due to the password field issue, we might need to identify the correct selector for the password field. You could help by inspecting the password input element on the login page in your browser and providing its attributes (like `id`, `name`, `type`, or a unique class).

---

**User**

enter the password

---

**Cursor**

You're right, the previous attempt to fill the password failed. I need to try filling the password field again.

Could you tell me the correct CSS selector for the password input field on your Medplum login page? You can usually find this by right-clicking the password field in your browser, selecting "Inspect" or "Inspect Element," and then looking at the HTML for attributes like `id`, `name`, `type`, or `class`.

For example, it might be something like:
*   `input[type='password']`
*   `#password` (if it has an ID of "password")
*   `input[name='current-password']`

Once I have the correct selector, I'll use it to fill the password.

Thank you for the screenshot! While it shows the general page structure with the "Password *" field visible, the developer tools are currently highlighting the `<body>` tag, not the specific password input element itself.

To get the precise selector, you would typically:
1.  Right-click directly on the password input field (where you type the password).
2.  Select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element."
3.  The developer tools should then highlight the `<input ...>` tag for the password field. You can then see its `id`, `name`, `type`, or `class`.

However, I can try the most common selector for a password field, which is `input[type='password']`. Let's attempt to fill the password using this.

That seems to have worked! The password field was successfully filled using the selector `input[type='password']`.

Now, I'll click the submit button again to complete the login. I'll use the common selector `button[type='submit']`.

Okay, I've clicked the submit button.

To verify if the login was successful and I'm on the dashboard or the next page, I'll take another screenshot.

I've taken a screenshot named `after_successful_login_attempt`. Please check it to see if the login was successful. If it was, you should see the Medplum dashboard or a project selection page.

If I'm logged in, we can then proceed with the conceptual discussion of **Step 4.3.1. Multi-Project Strategy Definition**.
