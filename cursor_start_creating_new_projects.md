let resume and start by creating new projects

---

**Cursor**

Okay, let's resume and start creating the new sample projects.

We are at **Step 4.3.3.1. Create a few sample `Project` entities in your local Medplum instance to represent different hospitals.**

You've confirmed you're on the "Projects" page, you see the "Super Admin" and "FHIR R4" projects, and there's a "New..." button.

I will now attempt to click the "New..." button using Puppeteer.

I've clicked the "New..." button. This should have opened a form to create a new Project resource.

To proceed, I need to:
1.  Identify the input field for the Project's name.
2.  Fill in the name for our first sample project: "General Hospital - Site A".
3.  Identify and click the button to save/submit the new project.

I'll take a screenshot of the current page (the new project form) so you can see it and help me identify the correct selectors for the name field and the save button if needed.

I've taken a screenshot named `new_project_form_page`.

Please look at the form (either in your browser via the Puppeteer session or the screenshot if accessible).
*   What is the CSS selector (e.g., `id`, `name` attribute) for the input field where I should type the project name ("General Hospital - Site A")? Common ones are `input[name='name']` or an input field with an `id` like `name` or `projectName`.
*   What is the text or CSS selector for the button to save/create this new project? Common ones are "Save", "Create", "Submit", or `button[type='submit']`.

**User**

we will not use puppeteer as it is no longer installed

**Cursor**

Okay, understood. We will proceed without using Puppeteer, and I'll guide you through the steps to perform manually in your browser.

We are at **Step 4.3.3.1. Create a few sample `Project` entities in your local Medplum instance to represent different hospitals.**

You should be logged into your local Medplum admin app as `admin@example.com`. Please ensure you are on the "Projects" page, which lists the existing "Super Admin" and "FHIR R4" projects.

1.  **Create the first sample project ("General Hospital - Site A"):**
    *   Please click the **"New..."** button on the Projects page. This should open a form to create a new `Project` resource.
    *   On the new project form, locate the input field for the **project name**.
    *   Enter the name: `General Hospital - Site A`
    *   Locate and click the button to **save** or **create** this new project (it might be labeled "Save", "Create", "Submit", etc.).

    After you've saved it, you should be taken back to the Projects list, and "General Hospital - Site A" should now appear in the list.

2.  **Create the second sample project ("Wellness Clinic - Site B"):**
    *   From the Projects list page, again click the **"New..."** button.
    *   In the project name field, enter: `Wellness Clinic - Site B`
    *   Locate and click the button to **save** or **create** this new project.

    "Wellness Clinic - Site B" should now also appear in your list of projects.

Please perform these steps. Let me know when you have successfully created both "General Hospital - Site A" and "Wellness Clinic - Site B", and they are visible in your projects list.

---

**User**

They have both been created and are visible in the list of projects

---

**Cursor**

Excellent! That completes **Step 4.3.3.1.**

Now we move to **Step 4.3.3.2. Create sample users (practitioners, patients) and `ProjectMembership` resources locally to test access control.**

Let's do this in three parts:
1.  Create a sample Hospital Staff user (as a `Practitioner` resource).
2.  Create a sample `Patient` resource within one of the hospital projects.
3.  Create a `ProjectMembership` resource to link the hospital staff user to that project.

---

**Part 1: Create a Sample Hospital Staff User (as a `Practitioner`)**

1.  Navigate to the section in your Medplum app where you can view and create FHIR resources (the same place where you could create `StructureDefinition`s, `ValueSet`s, or `Patient`s earlier).
2.  Select to create a new **`Practitioner`** resource.
3.  Fill in some basic details for this sample staff member. For example:
    *   **Name:**
        *   Family Name: `Staff`
        *   Given Name: `Alice`
        *   Prefix: `Dr.`
    *   You can add an **Identifier** if you wish, but it's not strictly necessary for this local test.
4.  **Save** this new `Practitioner` resource.

Let me know once Dr. Alice Staff is created.

---

**Part 2: Create a Sample `Patient` Resource**

1.  In the same FHIR resource management area, select to create a new **`Patient`** resource.
2.  Fill in basic details:
    *   **Name:**
        *   Family Name: `Doe`
        *   Given Name: `John`
    *   **Important: Associate this Patient with a Project.**
        *   When creating or editing the `Patient` resource, you should see an option to set the **Project** for this resource. This might be a dropdown menu or a field labeled "Project" or found under `meta.project`.
        *   Please select **"General Hospital - Site A"** as the project for this patient. This is crucial for testing project-based access control later.
3.  **Save** this new `Patient` resource.

Let me know once John Doe is created and associated with "General Hospital - Site A".

---

**Part 3: Create a `ProjectMembership` Resource**

The `ProjectMembership` resource is what formally links a user (like Dr. Alice Staff) to a specific project (like "General Hospital - Site A") and, eventually, an access policy.

1.  You'll likely create `ProjectMembership` resources in one of two ways:
    *   **Through the Project's detail page:** Navigate to the "General Hospital - Site A" project details page. Look for a tab or section related to "Users," "Members," "Team," or "Access." There might be an option there to "Invite User" or "Add Member," which would create a `ProjectMembership`.
    *   **As a direct FHIR resource:** In the FHIR resource management area, select to create a new **`ProjectMembership`** resource directly.

    Please try finding the option to add a member/user to the "General Hospital - Site A" project first. If that's not obvious, then try creating a `ProjectMembership` resource directly.

2.  When creating the `ProjectMembership`, you'll need to specify:
    *   **`project`**: This should be a reference to the "General Hospital - Site A" `Project`. If you're creating it from within the project's page, this might be pre-filled.
    *   **`profile`**: This should be a reference to the `Practitioner` resource for Dr. Alice Staff that you created in Part 1. (e.g., `Practitioner/resource-id-of-alice-staff`).
    *   **`user`**: This field links to the Medplum `User` account.
        *   When you created the `Practitioner` for Dr. Alice Staff, Medplum might not have automatically created a `User` account for her yet that she can log in with.
        *   Often, when inviting a user to a project or creating a `ProjectMembership`, there's an option to also invite them by email, which then creates their `User` account.
        *   For now, if you can set the `profile` to Dr. Alice Staff's `Practitioner` resource, that's a good start. We might need to also create a corresponding `User` resource for her and link it here, or use an "invite" flow if available. Let's see what fields are available on the `ProjectMembership` form.
    *   **`accessPolicy`**: Leave this blank for now, or select a default one if the field is mandatory and no "blank" option is available. We will create and assign our specific "Hospital Staff Access Policy" in the next step (4.3.3.3).

3.  **Save** the `ProjectMembership`.

This step can sometimes be a bit tricky depending on the Medplum UI flow for user invitations vs. direct `ProjectMembership` creation. Do your best, and let me know what fields you see and what you were able to set. We can refine this if needed.

Take your time with these three parts, and let me know how it goes!

---

**User**

Dr. Alice Staff has been created

---

**Cursor**

Great! Dr. Alice Staff (`Practitioner`) is created.

Now, please proceed with **Part 2: Create a Sample `Patient` Resource**.

Remember to:
1.  Create a new `Patient`.
2.  Name them John Doe (or similar).
3.  **Crucially, associate this `Patient` with the "General Hospital - Site A" project.** Look for a "Project" field or `meta.project` setting on the Patient creation form.
4.  Save the `Patient`.

Let me know when John Doe is created and assigned to "General Hospital - Site A".

---

**User**

I have attempted to create Patient John Doe. However, there is no way to connect them with General Hospital Site A. It may be that in this admin app where I am the super user, creating any resources is only creating the resource within the SuperAdmin project

---

**Cursor**

That's a very astute observation, and you're likely correct.

When you're operating as a super-admin *without explicitly switching your active project context*, Medplum will often default to creating resources within your current session's active project, which for a super-admin might indeed be the "Super Admin" project or the default top-level project.

**Here's how to correctly associate the Patient with "General Hospital - Site A":**

1.  **Switch Your Active Project Context:**
    *   In the Medplum app UI, there should be a way for you (as super-admin) to switch your current active project. This is often a dropdown menu at the top of the page, or within your user profile menu, listing all projects you have access to (which includes "General Hospital - Site A" and "Wellness Clinic - Site B" that you created).
    *   Please find this project switcher and select **"General Hospital - Site A"** to make it your active project.
    *   Once you've switched, the UI should confirm your current project context (e.g., the project name might appear prominently).

2.  **Create the `Patient` (John Doe) Again:**
    *   Now that "General Hospital - Site A" is your active project, navigate to the FHIR resource creation section.
    *   Create a new `Patient` resource.
    *   Fill in the details for John Doe.
    *   This time, because "General Hospital - Site A" is your active context, the `Patient` resource should *automatically* be created within this project. The "Project" field on the Patient form might even be pre-filled or not shown because it's inferred from your active project.
    *   Save the `Patient`.

3.  **Verify (Optional but Recommended):**
    *   After saving, you can view the `Patient` resource's details (e.g., its JSON representation) and look at the `meta.project` field to confirm it references "General Hospital - Site A".

Please try switching your active project to "General Hospital - Site A" first, and then create John Doe. Let me know if that works! This project context is fundamental to Medplum's operation.

---

**User**

Can you look at the ProjectMembership resource. I think this may have something to do with associating a user with multiple projects

---

**Cursor**

You're absolutely right to bring up `ProjectMembership`! It's the cornerstone for associating users with projects and defining their access. We're about to get to creating one for Dr. Alice Staff.

However, before we create the `ProjectMembership` for Dr. Staff to access "General Hospital - Site A", we first need to ensure there's a patient (John Doe) *correctly created within that specific project*.

The issue you encountered (not being able to select the project for John Doe) strongly suggests that as a super-admin, your actions were defaulting to your current active project (likely "Super Admin" project).

**So, could you please first try the steps I outlined previously to switch your active project?**

1.  **Find the project switcher** in your Medplum UI (often a dropdown at the top or in your user menu).
2.  Select **"General Hospital - Site A"** to make it your active project.
3.  *Then*, try creating the `Patient` John Doe again. With "General Hospital - Site A" as your active context, he should automatically be created within that project.

Once John Doe is successfully created *inside* "General Hospital - Site A", we'll then move to **Part 3: Create a `ProjectMembership` Resource** for Dr. Alice Staff, linking her to "General Hospital - Site A". This `ProjectMembership` will allow her, once an appropriate `AccessPolicy` is attached, to interact with John Doe.

After we set up this first `ProjectMembership`, I can elaborate on how a user (like a pharma representative or an admin) might have multiple `ProjectMembership` resources to gain access to different projects, each potentially with a different `AccessPolicy`.

Please try the project switching and patient creation first. This step is crucial for the rest of our access control testing!

---

**User**

I still cannot switch between projects the way you are describing. However, I went and created a new ProjectMembership where I associated the superadmin with General Hospital Site A. After doing this, I am now able to switch between projects by signing in and out

---

**Cursor**

Ah, that's an interesting and resourceful way to manage your active project context! By creating a `ProjectMembership` for your super-admin user and linking them to "General Hospital - Site A", you've effectively told Medplum that this project is one of your primary contexts. Signing out and back in would then likely allow you to select "General Hospital - Site A" as your active project upon login, or it might become your default.

This achieves the goal! The important thing is that you now have a way to ensure your actions (like creating a `Patient`) are performed *within the context of "General Hospital - Site A"*.

**So, now that you can effectively set "General Hospital - Site A" as your active project (by logging in with that context):**

Please proceed to **Part 2: Create a Sample `Patient` Resource (John Doe) within "General Hospital - Site A"**.

1.  Ensure "General Hospital - Site A" is your active project context.
2.  Navigate to the FHIR resource creation section.
3.  Create a new `Patient` resource.
4.  Fill in the details for John Doe.
5.  Save the `Patient`. He should now be created within "General Hospital - Site A".

Let me know once John Doe is created successfully within the "General Hospital - Site A" project context. After that, we'll finally create the `ProjectMembership` for Dr. Alice Staff.

---

**User**

Before I proceed, Dr. Alice Smith is only visible in the Superadmin Project. Do we need to do anything about this?

---

**Cursor**

That's another excellent observation and a very good question to ask at this stage!

Yes, ideally, if Dr. Alice Staff is intended to be a practitioner working primarily *for* "General Hospital - Site A", her `Practitioner` FHIR resource should also reside *within the "General Hospital - Site A" project*.

Here's why and what we should do:

**Why it's better for Dr. Staff's `Practitioner` resource to be in the "General Hospital - Site A" project:**
1.  **Data Segregation:** It keeps all data related to "General Hospital - Site A" (including its staff) neatly within its own project boundaries.
2.  **Access Control:** When we create an `AccessPolicy` for hospital staff in "General Hospital - Site A", that policy will grant them rights to manage `Practitioner` resources *within that project*. If Dr. Staff's own `Practitioner` record is within the project, she (or other authorized staff in that project) can manage it according to that policy. If it's outside, managing her record might require different permissions or fall under super-admin control.
3.  **Clarity:** It makes the data model clearer – staff members are part of the project they work for.

**What to do:**
Since you've just created her and haven't linked her to anything critical yet (like a `ProjectMembership`), the easiest way to correct this is:

1.  **Ensure "General Hospital - Site A" is your active project context.** (You mentioned you can achieve this by signing out and back in, selecting "General Hospital - Site A" as your project during login, or if your recent `ProjectMembership` creation for the super-admin made it the default context when you're in it).
2.  **Delete the current `Practitioner` resource for Dr. Alice Staff** (the one that's currently in the "Super Admin" project).
    *   Navigate to where you manage FHIR resources.
    *   Find Dr. Alice Staff's `Practitioner` record.
    *   Delete it.
3.  **Re-create the `Practitioner` resource for Dr. Alice Staff** *while "General Hospital - Site A" is your active project context.*
    *   Go to create a new `Practitioner`.
    *   Enter her details again (Dr. Alice Staff).
    *   Save her. This time, she should be created within the "General Hospital - Site A" project.

This might seem like a bit of rework, but getting the project associations correct for key resources like `Practitioner` and `Patient` at this stage will save a lot of potential confusion later when we test access policies.

**So, the recommended order now is:**
1.  Set "General Hospital - Site A" as your active project.
2.  Delete the existing Dr. Alice Staff `Practitioner` (from Super Admin project).
3.  Re-create Dr. Alice Staff `Practitioner` (now she will be in "General Hospital - Site A").
4.  Then, proceed to create the `Patient` John Doe (he will also be created in "General Hospital - Site A" because it's your active project).

Let me know if this makes sense and when you've re-created Dr. Staff within "General Hospital - Site A"!

---

**User**

Ive recreated Dr. Staff. However, I did the steps out of order. I created Dr. Staff within General Hospital Site A first, and then went to delete the Dr. Staff I had created earlier in the Superadmin project. Interestingly, when logged into the Superadmin project, and on the Practitioner resource page, I was able to see both instances of Dr. Staff

---

**Cursor**

That's perfectly fine, and it's very interesting that you could see both `Practitioner` instances for Dr. Staff when logged into the Super Admin project!

This is likely because your super-admin user, by default, has visibility across *all* projects. So, when you view a list of `Practitioner` resources as a super-admin, Medplum might be showing you practitioners from all projects you have access to, possibly with an indicator of which project they belong to.

**The crucial part is that you now have:**
1.  A `Practitioner` resource for Dr. Alice Staff that correctly resides *within* the "General Hospital - Site A" project.
2.  You've (presumably) deleted the other Dr. Alice Staff `Practitioner` resource that was in the "Super Admin" project, so there's no duplicate.

**Please confirm: Did you delete the Dr. Staff instance from the "Super Admin" project?** It's good practice to avoid having duplicate test data if the intent was to "move" her.

Assuming the duplicate is gone, and Dr. Alice Staff now correctly exists only within "General Hospital - Site A", you can now proceed to:

**Part 2: Create a Sample `Patient` Resource (John Doe) within "General Hospital - Site A"**

1.  Ensure "General Hospital - Site A" is still your **active project context**.
2.  Navigate to the FHIR resource creation section.
3.  Create a new `Patient` resource.
4.  Fill in the details for John Doe.
5.  Save the `Patient`. He should now be created within "General Hospital - Site A".

Let me know once John Doe is created in "General Hospital - Site A". Then we'll tackle the `ProjectMembership` for Dr. Staff!

---

**User**

Yes I did delete Dr. Staff and have created John Doe under General Hospital Site A

---

**Cursor**

Fantastic! We now have:
*   "General Hospital - Site A" `Project` created.
*   Dr. Alice Staff (`Practitioner` resource) created *within* "General Hospital - Site A".
*   John Doe (`Patient` resource) created *within* "General Hospital - Site A".

This is excellent progress and sets a clean foundation.

Now we can finally move to **Part 3 (of Step 4.3.3.2): Create a `ProjectMembership` Resource for Dr. Alice Staff.**

This `ProjectMembership` will formally link Dr. Alice Staff to the "General Hospital - Site A" project.

Here's how to proceed:

1.  **Ensure "General Hospital - Site A" is your active project.** (This is important because you're creating a membership *for this project*).
2.  **Find where to create `ProjectMembership`s:**
    *   **Option A (Preferred if available): Via the Project's details page.**
        *   Navigate to the details page for the "General Hospital - Site A" `Project`.
        *   Look for a tab, section, or button related to "Users," "Members," "Team," or "Access."
        *   There might be an option like "Invite User," "Add Member," or "New ProjectMembership." This is often the most straightforward way.
    *   **Option B: As a direct FHIR resource.**
        *   If you can't find an "Add Member" type of button on the project page, go to the general FHIR resource management area (where you created `Practitioner` and `Patient`).
        *   Select to create a new **`ProjectMembership`** resource.

3.  **Fill in the `ProjectMembership` details:**
    *   **`project` (Reference to Project):**
        *   This field must reference the "General Hospital - Site A" `Project`.
        *   If you're using Option A (from the project page), this might be pre-filled.
        *   If using Option B, you'll need to select or enter the reference (e.g., `Project/resource-id-of-General-Hospital-Site-A`).
    *   **`profile` (Reference to Practitioner):**
        *   This field must reference Dr. Alice Staff's `Practitioner` resource (the one within "General Hospital - Site A").
        *   You'll need to find and select/enter the reference (e.g., `Practitioner/resource-id-of-alice-staff`).
    *   **`user` (Reference to User account):**
        *   This is where it gets a bit more involved. Dr. Alice Staff, as a `Practitioner` FHIR resource, doesn't automatically have a `User` account that she can log in with. The `User` resource in Medplum handles authentication.
        *   **If the UI has an "Invite user by email" option** when adding a member to the project: This is often the best way. You'd provide an email address for Dr. Staff (e.g., `alice.staff@example.com` - it doesn't have to be a real, working email for this local test). Medplum would then typically:
            *   Create a `User` resource.
            *   Send an "invite" (which, for local testing, might just mean the `User` is created and you'd set a password for them later or they'd be in a "pending" state).
            *   Link this new `User` to the `ProjectMembership`.
        *   **If you're creating `ProjectMembership` directly and need to link a `User`:**
            *   You might first need to go and create a separate `User` FHIR resource for Alice Staff. Give her an email (e.g., `alice.staff@example.com`) and set an initial password if the form allows.
            *   Then, in the `ProjectMembership`, you would reference this newly created `User` resource (e.g., `User/resource-id-of-alice-staff-user-account`).
        *   **What to do now:** Look at the form for creating the `ProjectMembership`.
            *   Is there an "invite by email" field? If so, use that with a test email like `alice.staff@example.com`.
            *   Does it require you to select an *existing* `User`? If so, and you don't have one for Alice, you may need to create one first.
            *   Sometimes, the form might just ask for the `profile` (the `Practitioner`) and handle User creation/invitation behind the scenes, or allow you to create it without an active `User` link initially (though this is less common for active memberships).
    *   **`accessPolicy` (Reference to AccessPolicy):**
        *   For now, leave this blank if possible.
        *   If the field is mandatory and you can't leave it blank, select any default or existing access policy available in the dropdown. We will create and assign our specific "Hospital Staff Access Policy" in the *next* step (4.3.3.3).
    *   **Other fields:** Fill in any other mandatory fields as best you can.

4.  **Save** the `ProjectMembership` resource.

This step has a few possibilities depending on your Medplum UI's workflow for user and membership management. Please try it, and let me know:
*   Which method did you use (via Project page or direct FHIR resource creation)?
*   What fields were available, especially regarding the `user` (User account) link?
*   Were you able to create and save the `ProjectMembership` linking Dr. Alice Staff's `Practitioner` profile to "General Hospital - Site A"?

We're getting close to being able to test access!

**User**

I went to the Project page. There was a users tab, whcih I clicked. There was an option to invite users, which opens a form. I am able to select between practitioner, patient and related person. I selected practitioner and entered Alice Staff details and put alice.staff@example as the email. I then clicked invite. Now while this did create a user, it also created a new Practitioner resource. So now I have 2 Alice Staff

---

**Cursor**

Ah, that's a common outcome with "invite" workflows! They often assume that if you're inviting a practitioner, you might not have created their `Practitioner` FHIR resource yet, so they create one for convenience.

No problem, we can clean this up. Here's what happened and how to fix it:

1.  **What happened:**
    *   You used the "Invite user" feature from the "General Hospital - Site A" project's "Users" tab.
    *   You provided Alice Staff's details and email.
    *   Medplum did the following:
        *   Created a new `User` account (with the email `alice.staff@example.com`).
        *   Created a *new* `Practitioner` resource based on the details you entered in the invite form.
        *   Created a `ProjectMembership` linking this *newly created* `User` and this *newly created* `Practitioner` to "General Hospital - Site A".

2.  **The result:**
    *   You have the *original* `Practitioner` resource for Dr. Alice Staff (the one you manually created within "General Hospital - Site A"). Let's call this `Practitioner A`.
    *   You have a *new* `Practitioner` resource for Dr. Alice Staff (created by the invite process). Let's call this `Practitioner B`.
    *   You have a `User` account for `alice.staff@example.com`.
    *   You have a `ProjectMembership` linking the `User` account and `Practitioner B` to the project.

**How to fix it (to use your original `Practitioner A`):**

Our goal is to have the `User` account (`alice.staff@example.com`) linked via `ProjectMembership` to your *original* `Practitioner A` and "General Hospital - Site A".

1.  **Delete the duplicate `Practitioner B`:**
    *   First, identify which `Practitioner` resource is the new, unwanted one (`Practitioner B`). It will likely have a different resource ID than `Practitioner A`. You might be able to tell by looking at their creation timestamps or by checking the `ProjectMembership` to see which `Practitioner` it references.
    *   Navigate to the FHIR resource view for `Practitioner`s.
    *   Carefully identify and **delete** `Practitioner B` (the one created by the invite process).

2.  **Update the existing `ProjectMembership`:**
    *   Now, find the `ProjectMembership` resource that was created by the invite process. (You can find this in the "Users" tab of the "General Hospital - Site A" project, or by searching for `ProjectMembership` resources.)
    *   **Edit** this `ProjectMembership`.
    *   It should currently be linking to:
        *   `project`: "General Hospital - Site A" (Correct)
        *   `user`: The `User` account for `alice.staff@example.com` (Correct - we want to keep this User account)
        *   `profile`: This will be referencing the now-deleted `Practitioner B` (or it might show an error if you deleted `Practitioner B` already).
    *   Change the **`profile`** field to reference your *original* `Practitioner A` (the one you manually created and want to keep). You'll need to search for or select Dr. Alice Staff's correct `Practitioner` resource.
    *   Ensure the `accessPolicy` field is still blank or set to a temporary default if mandatory.
    *   **Save** the changes to the `ProjectMembership`.

**After these steps, you should have:**
*   One `Practitioner` resource for Dr. Alice Staff (`Practitioner A`), correctly residing in "General Hospital - Site A".
*   One `User` account for `alice.staff@example.com`.
*   One `ProjectMembership` linking the `User` account (`alice.staff@example.com`) and `Practitioner A` to the "General Hospital - Site A" project.

This ensures Dr. Alice Staff has a login identity (`User`) and a clinical identity (`Practitioner`), both correctly associated with the project.

This cleanup is a normal part of figuring out an application's specific UI workflows! Please give these steps a try and let me know how it goes.

Can I instead delete Practitioner A instead?

Yes, you absolutely can delete `Practitioner A` (your originally created one) instead!

If the `Practitioner B` (the one created by the "invite user" process) has all the correct details for Dr. Alice Staff and is already correctly associated with the "General Hospital - Site A" project (which it should be, as it was created via that project's invite mechanism), then it's simpler to just keep `Practitioner B` and delete `Practitioner A`.

**So, the revised, simpler steps would be:**

1.  **Identify `Practitioner A`** (the one you manually created first and now want to delete).
2.  Navigate to the FHIR resource view for `Practitioner`s.
3.  Carefully identify and **delete `Practitioner A`**.

**This will leave you with:**
*   One `Practitioner` resource for Dr. Alice Staff (`Practitioner B`, created by the invite), correctly residing in "General Hospital - Site A".
*   One `User` account for `alice.staff@example.com`.
*   One `ProjectMembership` correctly linking this `User` account and `Practitioner B` to the "General Hospital - Site A" project.

This is a more direct way to achieve the desired clean state. Thank you for suggesting it!

Please proceed with deleting the `Practitioner` resource you originally created manually (`Practitioner A`). Let me know when that's done.

Excellent! That simplifies things.

So, to recap our current state for **Step 4.3.3.2**:
*   **Sample `Project`s created:** "General Hospital - Site A" and "Wellness Clinic - Site B".
*   **Sample Hospital Staff `Practitioner` created:** Dr. Alice Staff (the one created via the invite process, now the sole one), residing in "General Hospital - Site A".
*   **Sample `Patient` created:** John Doe, residing in "General Hospital - Site A".
*   **`ProjectMembership` created:** This links the `User` account for `alice.staff@example.com` (which was also created during the invite) and Dr. Alice Staff's `Practitioner` resource to the "General Hospital - Site A" project. The `accessPolicy` on this `ProjectMembership` is currently not set or is set to a default.

This successfully completes **Step 4.3.3.2. Create sample users (practitioners, patients) and `ProjectMembership` resources locally to test access control.** We have the basic entities in place.

Now, we move to the exciting part: **Step 4.3.3.3. Implement and test the designed `AccessPolicy` resources locally.**

We'll start by creating the `AccessPolicy` for Hospital Staff.

**Create the "Hospital Staff Access Policy"**

Based on our design in **Step 4.3.2.1** (and your later addition of `ResearchStudy` and `ResearchSubject`), this policy should grant full CRUD access to specific resources *within the member's project*.

1.  **Ensure "General Hospital - Site A" is your active project.** (Though for creating a system-wide `AccessPolicy` like this, it might also be done from the Super Admin project context, as `AccessPolicy` resources themselves are not usually project-specific, but are *applied* within a project via `ProjectMembership`. Let's try creating it while "General Hospital - Site A" is active; if it forces it into that project, we can adjust. Ideally, `AccessPolicy` resources are global and can be referenced by any `ProjectMembership`.)
2.  Navigate to the FHIR resource management area where you can create new resources.
3.  Select to create a new **`AccessPolicy`** resource.
4.  Give it a descriptive **name** (and optionally, a title and description). For example:
    *   `name`: `HospitalStaffPolicy`
    *   `title`: `Hospital Staff Access Policy`
    *   `description`: `Grants hospital staff full CRUD access to necessary resources within their assigned project.`
5.  Now, you'll need to define the **`resource`** array. Each element in this array is an object that specifies permissions for a given FHIR resource type. You'll need one object for each of the following resource types: `Patient`, `Observation`, `DiagnosticReport`, `Binary`, `ServiceRequest`, `Encounter`, `Practitioner`, `Organization`, `ResearchStudy`, `ResearchSubject`.

    For *each* of these resource types, the object in the `resource` array should look something like this (this is conceptual JSON, the UI might have separate fields):

    ```json
    {
      "resourceType": "[FHIR Resource Name, e.g., Patient]",
      "criteria": "Patient.meta.project = '%project.id'", // Or similar FHIRpath to ensure it's within the current project
      // The UI might have a more direct way to specify "restrict to project compartment"
      // If your Medplum UI has a specific field for "compartment" or "restrict to project", use that.
      // The FHIRpath '%project.id' is a common Medplum convention to refer to the ID of the project
      // to which the ProjectMembership (that uses this policy) belongs.
      "access": [ // Some UIs might have checkboxes for read/write/delete
        {"permission": "read"},
        {"permission": "write"}, // 'write' usually covers create and update
        {"permission": "delete"}
      ]
    }
    ```
    *   **`resourceType`**: The name of the FHIR resource (e.g., "Patient").
    *   **`criteria`**: This is where we enforce the "within their assigned project" rule. The exact FHIRpath might vary based on Medplum's implementation, but `[ResourceType].meta.project = '%project.id'` is a common pattern. If the UI has a simpler "restrict to project compartment" option, that's even better.
        *   **Important Note on `criteria` for `Practitioner` and `Organization`:** For `Practitioner` and `Organization` resources that *represent* the staff and the hospital itself within its own project, this project-based criteria is correct.
    *   **`access`**: You need to grant `read`, `write`, and `delete`. In some UIs, this might be separate checkboxes or multi-select options rather than an array like this.

    You will add one such rule object to the `resource` array for *each* of the 10 resource types listed above.

6.  **Save** the new `AccessPolicy` resource.

This step is detailed because `AccessPolicy` resources are powerful and precise. Take your time with the UI. If the `criteria` field is tricky, focus on finding how the UI allows you to restrict the policy rule to the "current project compartment" for the user.

Let me know:
*   If you can find where to create the `AccessPolicy`.
*   What the UI fields look like for defining a rule (resourceType, criteria/compartment, permissions).
*   If you're able to create and save this "HospitalStaffPolicy" with rules for all 10 resource types. If it's easier, you can start with just `Patient` and `Practitioner` to get a feel for it, and then add the others.

```json
    {
      "resourceType": "[FHIR Resource Name, e.g., Patient]",
      "criteria": "Patient.meta.project = '%project.id'", // Or similar FHIRpath to ensure it's within the current project
      // The UI might have a more direct way to specify "restrict to project compartment"
      // If your Medplum UI has a specific field for "compartment" or "restrict to project", use that.
      // The FHIRpath '%project.id' is a common Medplum convention to refer to the ID of the project
      // to which the ProjectMembership (that uses this policy) belongs.
      "access": [ // Some UIs might have checkboxes for read/write/delete
        {"permission": "read"},
        {"permission": "write"}, // 'write' usually covers create and update
        {"permission": "delete"}
      ]
    }
```
